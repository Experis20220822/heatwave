The idea behind this capstone was to develop a project that makes use of the information we have learned over the past nine weeks.

This project includes various functionalities, including:

- User account creation
- User profile
- Creating an Invoice
- Enquires/ Ask a question page
- File upload (work in progress)
- CRUD operations on the database
- CI/CD
- Unit tests
- Modular architecture
- Scalability

The project was developed in Play! framework and Scala. We have also utilised HMRC the frontend and scaffolding structure.
